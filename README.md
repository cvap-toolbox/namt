**Not Another Matlab Toolbox**

General toolbox library for Matlab. Useful helper files that Matlab is lacking.

**beepme** - Outputs a sound beep of given length. Default is 50ms.

**ccc** - Clears all variables, closes all plots and clears the screen. Clean slate.

**cle** - Closes all open Matlab editor windows.

**getDirFileList** - Given a directory the function returns a cell array of the files in that directory. The function is recursive so it also finds the files in subdirectories. If an specific file extension is specified then it only returns the names of the files with those extensions.

**matpNorm** - Computes the p-norm of each row or column of a matrix. Default is row wise 2-norm.

**myPlot3** - Given M by N data matrix, where either M = 3 or N = 3, it makes a 3D point plot.

**sumall** - Sums all elements in a matrix.

**tridiag** - Creates a tri-diagonal matrix given a main diagonal and a sup-diagonal and sub-diagonal vectors.
